# Machine Translation with RNNs
Machine Translation with RNN Udacity's NLP project.

In this project, was built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

Diferent RNNs models were compared. Simple RNN, RNN with word embedding, Biderectional RNN, Encoder-Decoder RNN and a mixed model with all the previous approaches.
